# Pong Neural Network

This is a Python program that trains two competing neural network models in Pong.
  
This project was built entirely in Python. The primary libraries are Pygame for the display and Pytorch for the learning algorithms.

## Usage

First, download the necessary files from the [repository](https://jacobziff.github.io/pong/). Navigate to the folder, and open it in an environment such as Visual Studio Code. If necessary, install the required libraries. For example, using pip, run the following:
```
pip install pygame
```
```
pip install torch torchvision
```
Once installed, all that is needed is to run the "agent" Python file. The two AIs will begin immediately. To adjust the speed of the game, use the up and down arrow keys (does not affect AI performance). To exit, close the window or use the escape key. Going at the fastest speed, it takes a few minutes to see significant results. Some game statistics will be shown in the terminal output.
